# Building Eenrgy Datasets (BED)
The Existing Open-source/non-open-source Datasets related to Building Energy of various Time Granularity



## Missions

- [ ] Problem Definition: Define the problem you want to solve, the goals you want to achieve, and the data you need.
- [ ] Data Collection: Gather relevant data from various sources and store it in a suitable format for analysis.
- [ ] Data Cleaning: Remove any irrelevant, incomplete, or inconsistent data from the dataset. This includes removing duplicates, correcting errors, and handling missing data.
- [ ] Data Integration: Combine data from different sources and formats to create a single dataset for analysis.
- [ ] Data Transformation: Convert the data into a suitable format for analysis. This includes feature engineering, normalization, and data discretization.
- [ ] Data Mining: Apply various techniques such as classification, clustering, regression, and association rule mining to the prepared dataset.
- [ ] Pattern Evaluation: Evaluate the patterns and insights discovered in the previous step, including the accuracy, completeness, and usefulness of the results.
- [ ] Knowledge Representation: Present the results in a suitable format, such as tables, charts, and graphs, to facilitate understanding and decision-making.
- [ ] Deployment: Deploy the results to the relevant stakeholders, such as business executives, data analysts, or end-users, to take appropriate actions based on the insights obtained.
- [ ] Monitoring: Monitor the results to assess their performance over time and to detect any changes or anomalies in the data.
